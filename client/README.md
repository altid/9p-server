# Example 9p Client

This client is a very simple client which writes the body of `document` or writes the URL of `stream` to stdout, and reads from stdin for command/input messages
`feed` elements are not currently supported, to keep things simple.

## Usage

`example <ip address> [<ip address> ...]`

## Commands

Any input with a leading slash will be read as a command, and sent through to the underlying service, except for the following

 - `/tabs` will list all current buffers
 - `/sidebar` will list the items in the sidebar
 - `/status` will print the current buffer status
 - `/title` will print the current buffer title
 - `/quit` will end the program

## Input

Any text without a leading slash will be written to the `input` file of the given buffer, if it exists. If input is disabled for the buffer, an error will be returned.
